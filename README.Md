# Hotel Application Template

### This project is the template you're going to use for your final project.

### Quick Summary 

##### - Domain Layer contains all entities. Use as implemented, if anything concerns you or needs to be changed - ask a mentor.
##### - Repository Layer is a home-made JPA Repository to mock some database operations, without validations! Use as implemented, if anything concerns you or needs to be changed - ask a mentor.
##### - Service layer is where all the business logic should be. This is where all the magic happens. Implement and validate like there's no tomorrow. 
## Seriously all validations should be done in the service layer!!!


## Final Task: Implement the following functionality in the service layer!
    - /guests
            POST:   create a guest
            GET:    return all guests
    
    - /guests/id
            GET:    return guest by id
            UPDATE: update a guest by id
            REMOVE: remove a guest by id
       
    - /booking
            POST:   create a booking
            GET:    return all bookings
      
    - /booking/id
            GET:    return booking by id
            UPDATE: update a booking by id
            REMOVE: remove a booking by id
            

## EXCLAIMER: <p>The domain layer and repository layers should be treated like third party libraries and used without changing anything.

# To be updated and documented!
